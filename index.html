					<h3>Profile</h3>
					<p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 20">
						I am a hard working lady looking for a IT System Administrator or IT System Engineer position in South Africa, 
						particularly the Gauteng Province and I possess a valid Critical Skills Visa in 
						Information Technology. I am an MCP and MCSA : Windows Server 2012 working largely with Windows Server 
						and most of its roles such as AD, DNS, DHCP, Remote Desktop Services and more, Exchange, SCCM and VMWare, learning 
						cloud infrastructure  as we move towards cloud based datacenters. I am also a Java, HTML, CSS Developer and have been 
						able to occasionally apply my java skills to simplify my System Administrator duties.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 20">
						I am intrigued by Technology and therefore love learning new technologies, infact, I love learning in general.
						I am also inclined towards community building due to a lack of females in the STEM field and contribute mostly 
						by spreading knowledge and mentoring.
